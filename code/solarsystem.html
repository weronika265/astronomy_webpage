            <h3 class="item1" id="sun">Sun</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/sun.png" alt="Sun" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
                nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective
                motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
                It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
                Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or
                109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times
                that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of
                the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass
                consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%),
                with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including
                oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
            <h3 class="item1" id="mercury">Mercury</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/mercury.png" alt="Mercury" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">The smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.
                Its orbit around the Sun takes only 87.97 days,
                the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. </br></br>
                Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
                inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as
                viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the
                Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western
                horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually
                in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like
                object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
            <h3 class="item1" id="venus">Venus</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/venus.png" alt="Venus" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the
                Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the
                naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit,
                and so never appears to venture far from the Sun. Venus orbits
                the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243
                Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any
                planet in the Solar System and goes in the opposite direction
                to all but Uranus. </br></br>
                Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
                "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to
                the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from
                Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the
                four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon
                dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92
                times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900m
                underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the
                Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K
                (462 °C), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is
                shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of
                sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from
                space in visible light.</p>

            <h3 class="item1" id="earth">Earth</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/earth.png" alt="Earth" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and
                other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
                ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space,
                especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural
                satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.265 days, a period
                known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth
                rotates about its axis about 366.265 times. </br></br>
                Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
                producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
                between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
                orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
                Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest
                and most massive of the four rocky planets.</p>

            <h3 class="item1" id="mars">Mars</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/mars.png" alt="Mars" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest
                planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars
                carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred
                to as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron
                oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish
                appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible
                to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
                atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the
                impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar
                ice caps of Earth. </br></br>
                There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability
                potential of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
            <h3 class="item1" id="jupiter">Jupiter</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/jupiter.png" alt="Jupiter" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
                Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that
                of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets
                in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest
                objects visible to the naked eye - on average it is the third
                brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. </br></br>
                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its
                mass being helium. It may also have a rocky core of heavier
                elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a
                well-defined solid surface. The outer atmosphere is visibly
                segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in
                turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.
                A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is
                known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it
                was first seen by telescope. </br></br>
                Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four large Galilean
                moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the
                largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planetMercury.</p>

            <img src="../img/transparent planets/saturn.png" alt="Saturn" class="item2" id="sat" />
            <p class="item3">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest
                in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an
                average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth
                the average density of Earth; however, with
                its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. </br></br>
                Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of
                iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core
                is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
                intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium,
                and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due
                to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.</p>

        <div class="container1">
            <h3 class="item1" id="uranus">Uranus</h3>
            <img src="../img/transparent planets/uranus.png" alt="Uranus" class="item2" />
            <p class="item3">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third largest
                planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in
                the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune,
                and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from
                that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this
                reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice
                giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. It has the
                coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a
                minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C). The interior of
                Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</p>
